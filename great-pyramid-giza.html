                <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
                <p>Built during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu (circa 2589-2566 BCE) of the Fourth Dynasty, the Great Pyramid was constructed as an elaborate tomb. It was the tallest man-made structure for over 3,800 years until the completion of the Lincoln Cathedral in 1311 CE.</p>

                <h2>Construction Details</h2>
                <p>The pyramid was built using approximately 2.3 million blocks of limestone, each weighing between 2.5 to 15 tons. The construction took approximately 20 years and required thousands of workers. The precision of its construction is remarkable, with the base level to within just 2.1 centimeters.</p>
