                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus was a monumental tomb built for Mausolus, a Persian governor of the Satrapy of Caria. Located in present-day Turkey, it was one of the most impressive structures of the ancient world and gave rise to the modern term "mausoleum."</p>

            <div class="detail-card">
                <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                <p>Built around 350 BCE by Mausolus's widow Artemisia II, the mausoleum was constructed to honor her husband. The structure was designed by the Greek architects Satyros and Pythius and took approximately 15 years to complete.</p>

                <h2>Architectural Features</h2>
                <p>The Mausoleum stood approximately 45 meters (148 feet) tall and featured a quadrangular base with four sides, each decorated with sculptural reliefs. The structure was crowned with a chariot sculpture drawn by four horses, called a quadriga.</p>

                <h2>Sculptural Decoration</h2>
                <p>The mausoleum was adorned with works by four of the greatest Greek sculptors of the time: Scopas, Bryaxis, Leochares, and Timotheus. The sculptural program depicted scenes of Greek mythology and the lives of Mausolus and Artemisia.</p>

                <h2>Destruction and Preservation</h2>
                <p>The mausoleum was destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent raids. In the 15th century, the Knights of Saint John used stones from the ruins to build a castle. Many of the surviving sculptures are now housed in the British Museum.</p>

                <h2>Lasting Impact</h2>
                <p>The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus inspired tomb structures throughout history. The word "mausoleum" itself comes from Mausolus's name, a testament to the monument's lasting influence on architecture and design.</p>
