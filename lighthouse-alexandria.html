                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The Lighthouse of Alexandria, also known as the Pharos of Alexandria, was one of the tallest and most impressive structures of the ancient world. It guided ships safely into the harbor of Alexandria, one of the most important ports of the Mediterranean.</p>

            <div class="detail-card">
                <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                <p>Built around 280 BCE during the reign of Ptolemy II of Egypt, the lighthouse was designed by the Greek architect Sostratus of Cnidus. It was constructed on the island of Pharos to help navigate the treacherous waters of Alexandria's harbor.</p>

                <h2>Architectural Marvel</h2>
                <p>The Lighthouse of Alexandria stood approximately 100 meters (330 feet) tall, making it one of the tallest structures of antiquity. Its structure consisted of three tiers: a square base, an octagonal middle section, and a cylindrical top crowned with a statue of Zeus or Poseidon.</p>

            <div class="detail-card">
                <h2>Ingenious Design</h2>
                <p>The lighthouse used mirrors and fire to reflect and amplify light that could be seen from miles away at sea. The internal structure featured a complex system of ramps, pulleys, and mirrors that allowed attendants to maintain the flame and signal to ships.</p>

            <div class="detail-card">
                <h2>Historical Destruction</h2>
                <p>The lighthouse remained operational for over 1,600 years before being damaged by earthquakes in the 12th and 14th centuries. Eventually, it was completely destroyed, and the Citadel of Qaitbay was built on the same site in the 15th century.</p>

                <h2>Lasting Legacy</h2>
                <p>The Lighthouse of Alexandria inspired lighthouse designs throughout history and served as a symbol of maritime navigation and human achievement. Fragments of the lighthouse have been recovered underwater and are displayed in museums.</p>
