                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The Colossus of Rhodes was a colossal bronze statue of the Greek sun-god Helios that once stood in the ancient city of Rhodes on the Greek island of Rhodes. It was one of the tallest structures of the ancient world.</p>

            <div class="detail-card">
                <h2>Construction</h2>
                <p>Built between 292 and 280 BCE by the Greek sculptor Chares of Lindos, the Colossus took approximately 12 years to complete. It was constructed using bronze plates and an iron frame, with a stone and rubble foundation for support.</p>

            <div class="detail-card">
                <h2>Impressive Dimensions</h2>
                <p>The statue stood approximately 33 meters (108 feet) tall, making it roughly the height of a modern 11-story building. Its base was 15 meters (49 feet) long, and the entire structure weighed approximately 225 tons.</p>

            <div class="detail-card">
                <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
                <p>The Colossus was built to celebrate Rhodes' victory over an invading army and to honor Helios, the city's patron deity. It quickly became one of the most famous monuments of the ancient world, symbolizing the power and prosperity of Rhodes.</p>

                <h2>Short-Lived Wonder</h2>
                <p>Tragically, the Colossus stood for only 54 years. In 226 BCE, an earthquake broke the statue at the knees, and it fell to the ground. The remains lay undisturbed for approximately 800 years before being sold off as scrap metal.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>Though the Colossus no longer stands, it remains one of the most iconic symbols of ancient architecture and engineering. The statue inspired modern monuments, including the Statue of Liberty, and continues to captivate the imagination of people worldwide.</p>
