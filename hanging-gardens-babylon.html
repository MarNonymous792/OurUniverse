                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon are legendary terraced gardens said to have been located in ancient Babylon, Iraq. They are one of the most enigmatic of the Seven Wonders, as no definitive archaeological evidence has been found to prove their existence.</p>

                <h2>Historical Accounts</h2>
                <p>According to ancient sources, the gardens were built by King Nebuchadnezzar II (605-562 BCE) for his Median wife Amytis, who missed her mountainous homeland. The gardens were described by Greek historians Strabo and Diodorus Siculus as extraordinarily beautiful and ingeniously constructed.</p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Ancient texts describe the Hanging Gardens as a series of vaulted arches built of baked brick and bitumen, rising to a height of about 23 meters (75 feet). The gardens featured exotic plants, trees, and flowers arranged on multiple levels, creating a lush paradise in the midst of the Mesopotamian desert.</p>

                <h2>Irrigation System</h2>
                <p>The most remarkable aspect of the gardens was their ingenious irrigation system. According to historical accounts, water was lifted from the Euphrates River using a system of pumps or screw pumps and distributed throughout the gardens to keep the plants alive in the arid climate.</p>

The gardens remain one of history's greatest mysteries.</p>
